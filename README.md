# Brutalist Sci-Fi Interactive Portfolio

## Description

This project is a single-page personal portfolio website designed with a brutalist, modern, and sleek sci-fi aesthetic. It utilizes JavaScript states to simulate "pages," where navigation centers around interacting with a dynamic 3D scene powered by Three.js. The core visual is an animated DNA-like double helix, with different sections of the site corresponding to unique camera angles and perspectives on this central 3D object. The design aims for an understated, "alive" feel, reminiscent of a minimalistic laboratory interface.

The entire experience is contained within a single HTML file, leveraging CDN-hosted libraries for Three.js and Tailwind CSS.
